# Case Study during the WBS-DataAnalytics-Bootcamp: Eniac's expansion to the Brazilian market with a help of Magist

## Project Overview
Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, was founded in Spain and has successfully expanded to neighboring countries. Now, Eniac is exploring an entry into the Brazilian market—a region with eCommerce revenue comparable to Spain and Italy, and with significant growth potential. However, Eniac faces a major challenge: a limited understanding of the Brazilian market.

To address this, Eniac is considering a partnership with Magist, a prominent Brazilian Software as a Service (SaaS) company that provides a centralized order management system. Magist connects small and medium-sized stores to the largest Brazilian marketplaces, leveraging its economies of scale to offer competitive advantages.

Despite Magist's strong market presence, Eniac has two key concerns:

1. Product Fit: Eniac's product catalog is entirely focused on high-end tech, particularly Apple-compatible accessories. There is uncertainty about whether the marketplaces Magist serves are the right platform for such premium products.

2. Delivery Speed: Fast delivery is crucial to Eniac’s customer satisfaction strategy. While Magist’s partnership with the Brazilian Post Office may offer cost-effective delivery, there are concerns about whether delivery times will meet Eniac’s standards.

To address these concerns, this project involved data exploration using MySQL Workbench and data visualization with Tableau, providing insights to guide Eniac’s decision on entering the Brazilian market.

## Tools Used
  * SQL (MySQL Workbench)

  Utilized to extract and analyze data, offering detailed insights into market trends, sales performance, and delivery logistics in the Brazilian market. SQL queries helped uncover critical data points that informed the decision-making process.
  * Tableau

  Used to create visualizations, including maps and bar charts, to effectively represent the data. Tableau's interactive dashboards provided a clear and visual interpretation of complex data, aiding in the communication of key insights.
  * Google Slides

  Employed to compile and present the findings in a structured and visually appealing format. The presentation integrates data insights and visualizations to support strategic recommendations for Eniac's expansion into Brazil.

## Summary of Key Insights
  * Growth Potential: Brazil’s eCommerce market is rapidly expanding, with revenue expected to more than double by 2024, making it a promising yet challenging market for Eniac’s entry.

  * Product-Market Fit: Eniac’s high-end Apple-compatible accessories may not align perfectly with the typical product offerings on Magist’s connected marketplaces.

  * Revenue Gap: Magist’s total revenue remains small compared to Eniac’s expectations, suggesting that Eniac may need to temper its financial projections if partnering with Magist.

  * Geographical Sales Disparities: Magist’s sales are heavily concentrated in wealthier regions like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, while northern regions see significantly lower sales, posing a challenge for nationwide expansion.

  * Logistical Challenges: Delivery times are acceptable in major cities but can extend up to 30 days in remote areas, potentially compromising Eniac's commitment to fast shipping.

  * Customer Feedback: While Magist enjoys a solid reputation with an average customer rating of 4.1/5, occasional delivery and product issues highlight areas for improvement in customer experience.

## Potential Competitors
Mercado Livre (MELI):
  * founded in 1999 
  * recognized as a market leader in Brazil’s online shopping ecosystem
  * offers same-day or next-day delivery in large metropolitan areas
  * such as São Paulo
  * remote areas within 7-15+ days by the state postal service (Correios)
  * logistics infrastructure expanded
***
## Conclusion
Magist fits to Eniac’s needs as a short-term entry partner:
  * growing delivery volume 
  * improving delivery performance 

But not an ideal long-term partner for ENIAC’s high-end tech strategy:
  * low tech focus 
  * delivery risk for large products
